# Portfolio
## Intro
I'm a security researcher highly passionate about cryptography & blockchain security with proven track record of consistently uncovering vulnerabilities in wide specturm of DeFi protocols and performing at multiple audit contests. Before auditing smart contracts, I studied C, Python, Java, Web-Dev for open-source contribution, and during the journey started learning Smart Contract Development & Security.

I've experience in ERC20, ERC721, [ERC4626](https://github.com/this-vishalsingh/myblogs/blob/main/ERC4626.md), ERC4337, Lending, AMMs, Proxies, Staking, Restaking, EVM. I am proficient in auditing code in Solidity and am trying to add more frameworks to my portfolio in the future.

#### Background
Currently studing Electronics & Communication Engineering from India. I like maths, physics.
