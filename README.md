## Biography
Hey,
I'm an expert Solidity, Rust smart contracts & ZK Security Researcher and the creator of [ZippelLabs](https://x.com/Zippel_Labs) - [zp1](https://github.com/this-vishalsingh/zp1), a ZK proving toolstack.

For audit and contract work, please reach out on [X](https://x.com/thisvishalsingh) or [telegram](https://t.me/thisvishalsingh).

Below I have detailed my audit experience, education and articles.

I'm particularly expert in auditing Solidity and Rust: 
- ZKPs ( Identity, DeFi, Payments, Prover Networks, zkVMs, Proof Verification, Coprocessors, ZK Rollups, ZK L1s, Cross Chain, ZKML/AI, ZK TLS, Private Compute, ZK in Bitcoin, Voting, CoSNARKs, Attestation Infrastructure),

- Privacy  (TEEs, MPC, FHE).


Solidity, Rust, Go, Circom, FunC, even Cairo: I find bugs in any language with above given intrestrd projects types (Defi-privacy & ZKPs)! 

Ethereum, Solana, even Bitcoin: I find bugs in any stack!

##### Skillset:
Math, ZK, Cryptography, Solidity, Rust, Privacy, Smart Contracts & DLT.
