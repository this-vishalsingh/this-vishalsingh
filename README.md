## Biography
Hey! thisvishalsingh here! I'm a Security Researcher focused on Blockchain/DLT and Smart Contract Security, active since 2023. 

I'm particularly interested in Lending, Privacy(TEEs, MPC, FHE) and ZKP. If you need some code to be reviewed, please reach out on [X](https://x.com/thisvishalsingh) or [telegram](https://t.me/thisvishalsingh).

I am also the creator of [ZippelLabs](https://x.com/Zippel_Labs) , a ZK proving toolstack for performance and security acceleration for zkVMs to prove Ethereum in real-time.

Solidity, Rust, Go, Circom, FunC, even Cairo: I find bugs in any language! 

Ethereum, Solana, even Bitcoin: I find bugs in any stack!

##### Skillset:
Math, ZK, Cryptography, Solidity, Rust, Privacy, Smart Contracts & DLT.
